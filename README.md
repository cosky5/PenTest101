***Hacking your first machine***

We will use a command-line application called "GoBuster" to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages. GoBuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and tries accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.
```
ubuntu@user:~/Desktop$ gobuster -u http://10.10.149.129 -w wordlist.txt dir

***Find hidden website pages***

Most companies will have an admin portal page, giving their staff access to basic admin controls for day-to-day operations. For a bank, an employee might need to transfer money to and from client accounts. Often these pages are not made private, allowing attackers to find hidden pages that show, or give access to, admin controls or sensitive data.

You will see that GoBuster scans the website with each word in the list, finding pages that exist on the site. GoBuster will have told you the pages it found in the list of page/directory names (indicated by Status: 200).


***Hack the bank***

You should have found a secret bank transfer page that allows you to transfer money between accounts at the bank (/bank-transfer). Type the hidden page into the FakeBank website on the machine.


If you were a penetration tester or security consultant, this is an exercise youâ€™d perform for companies to test for vulnerabilities in their web applications; find hidden pages to investigate for vulnerabilities.
